### Development
1. Fork repo to your personal profile
2. Clone your forked repo to your machine
3. Go inside newly cloned directory and `git remote add upstream git@github.digitalriverws.net:ux/react-atlas.git`
4. run `npm install`
5. run `npm start`
6. write tests & code in ES6 goodness :-)
7. run `git add whatever/files/you/changed.js`
8. run `npm run commit` and follow the prompt (this ensures that your commit message follows [our conventions](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/angular.md)).
9. notice that there's a pre-commit hook that runs to ensure tests pass and coverage doesn't drop to prevent the build from breaking :-)
10. push your changes
11. create a PR with a link to the original issue
12. wait patiently :-)
